SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea

The AI-Assisted Intelligent Interview & Evaluation System is designed to enhance RAC’s recruitment and promotion process by integrating Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning. It creates a structured, unbiased, and efficient interview experience by generating customized questions based on a candidate’s expertise, job role, and seniority. The system ensures progressive difficulty, starting with ice-breaking questions and moving to in-depth technical and managerial queries.

AI-powered real-time response evaluation scores answers based on technical accuracy, clarity, and depth of understanding, with panelists having the option to refine scores. A bias detection mechanism ensures fair assessments by analyzing expert scoring patterns. Additionally, AI provides question recommendations to prevent redundancy and maintain assessment relevance.

A centralized dashboard enables scheduling, performance tracking, and comparative analysis. The system generates detailed reports highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and overall suitability. Multilingual support ensures inclusivity, and end-to-end encryption protects sensitive data. Integrated with RAC’s recruitment portal, the system streamlines hiring, reduces manual effort, and ensures merit-based selection.

By adopting this AI-driven approach, RAC can improve transparency, efficiency, and accuracy, ultimately selecting the best talent for DRDO’s scientific and managerial roles while reducing biases and enhancing the overall evaluation process.
